<h2>For <em>Developers</em></h2>

<h4>Amidaâ€™s Open Source Philosophy</h4>

<p>Amida believes that the transformation of health IT requires a deeply collaborative approach, and that the best way to achieve the trust of disparate stakeholders is to be a model of openness and transparency.  Our goal is to make as much of our core technology as possible available under the permissive Apache 2.0 Software License. This allows flexibility and freedom regarding use, modification, and distribution of both the original software and modified versions.</p>
