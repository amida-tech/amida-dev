If you are just getting rolling with the PHIX platform, it is best to get a personal walk through of how the platform works. To help on-board developers with the overall platform, we have developed a multi-step walk through of every aspect of PHIX development.

The walk through starts with very basic concepts like what is PHIX, the technology behind PHIX, then each aspect of the PHIX API, leaving developers with an overview of support, PHIX resources and emphasizing that Amida needs you to contribute to make the community grow.

While the step-by-step walk-through will not be for every developer it will help the newest developers on-boarded with PHIX, allowing them to go from zero to installation and API integration as quick as possible.
