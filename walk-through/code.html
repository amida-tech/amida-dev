<p>All code for PHIX is open sourced under Apache 2.0 license, and available on Github. There are currently two main approaches for deploying, the first is a manual install on your own servers:</p>

<p>Fork / Download On Github w/ Manual Install - You can download the code and instal PHIX on your server that you have configured with with Node.js and MongoDB—all instructions are available on Github repository.</p>

<p>The second, more scalable approach is to use Amazon EC2, in which PHIX has two guides:</p>

<ul>
<li>DIRECT Deployment https://github.com/amida-tech/DIRECT-ansible - Step by step instructions for deployment, configuration of PHIX DIRECT on Amazon cloud infrastructure.</li>
<li>PHIX Deployment https://github.com/amida-tech/PHIX-ansible - Step by step instructions for deployment, configuration of PHIX on Amazon cloud infrastructure.</li>
</ul>

<p>PHIX is currently a prototype to demonstrate what is possible via open health information exchanges. As code evolves, and more tooling is development by Amida or the PHIX community, it will be made available via Github and openly licensed in according with PHIX, under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>
