Profile endpoints contains everything you need to know including contact information and demographics.</p>

<li>/profile (GET) - Retrieves the profile for the authenticated user.</li>
<li>/profile (PUT) - Creates a new profile for authenticated users.</li>
<li>/profile (POST) - Updates the profile for authenticated user.</li>
</ul>
