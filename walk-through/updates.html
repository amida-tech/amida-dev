<p>The PHIX updates area acts as a communication blog, telling stories around PHIX, developer deployments and all aspects of deploying healthcare information exchanges using PHIX.</p>

<p>Updates are available in a chronological order as they are added, but they are also referenced throughout other resources, such as this how-to guide and other support areas.</p> 

<p>Subscribe to the updates RSS feed to receive real-time updates around the PHIX community.</p>
