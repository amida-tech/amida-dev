      Amida strives to make health data accessible to modern developers by
      abstracting away the complex nuances of historical formats.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of the Data Reconciliation Engine (DRE) is to take personal health data
      in a variety of formats (starting with BlueButton/CCDA) from multiple
      sources and parse/normalize/de-duplicate/merge it into a single Patient's
      Master Health Record (with patient assistance), although most of hard
      work will be done automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      DRE relies heavily on the blue-button family of libraries to parse health
      record data in variety of formats into unified data model (JSON based),
      so information can be readily utilized for any application.
