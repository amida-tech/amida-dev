<p>The PHIX resources section is a listing of all resources available to the community. As resources are added to this PHIX site, they will be linked on the resources page.</p> 

<p>The resources page will also act as an external list of supporting standards, technologies, tooling and other resources that aren’t directly part of the PHIX community, but may help you in your deployments.</p> 

<p>If there is a resources you’d like to see added, please submit it via the Github issue manager and we’ll consider adding.</p>
