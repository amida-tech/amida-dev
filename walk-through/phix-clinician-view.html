<h3>PHIX User View</h3>

<p><img src="images/caduceus.png" align="right" width="200" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>

<p>The second view of the PHIX application is the clinician interface, also referenced as the provider. This is the view of the application that the health care providers users to manage health information for one or many individuals who use the PHIX platform.</p>

<p>This view is just as critical as the individual user view, but is about providing doctors what they need to easily manage their patients health information. Not all health care providers will be able to potentially use a separate interface, and it may be up to developers and technology providers like you to custom integrate with a providers existing system either via the PHIX API or through seamless integration of clinician view with single sign on (SSO) access.</p>
