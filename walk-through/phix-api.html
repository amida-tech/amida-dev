<h3>PHIX API</h3>

<p><img src="images/phix-api.png" align="right" width="200" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>

<p>PHIX is API centric, using the API to run individual and provider applications, and allowing for integration with any other systems. The PHIX API is a web API, developed in Node.js, and since the PHIX application uses the API, all features of the web application are available via the API.</p> 

<p>The PHIX API has a total of 12 areas of API methods you will need to understand as a developer and technology provider who will be delivering healthcare integration solutions for individuals and providers. The goal of this site is to not just help you understand the PHIX application, but develop and intimate understanding of the PHIX API surface area so you can easily develop custom integration with the platform.</p>

<p>If you are looking to get into the inner workings of the PHIX API, everything is available under /lib in the PHIX platform. Each of the 12 areas of the API have their own folder, representing the group of available endpoints. I recommend taking a look under the hood if you can, it helps understand the API more.</p>
