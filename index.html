        <h4>What is Amida Developers Community?</h4>
        
        <p>Amida believes that the transformation of health IT requires a deeply collaborative approach, and that the best way to achieve the trust of disparate stakeholders is to be a model of openness and transparency. This portal is meant to be a platform to not just publish open source software and tools from Amide Tech, but a place to encourage you, the developers who are closest to the individual patient to put this technology to use as well as contribute your own.</p>

        <p>To deliver PHIX and other Amida Tech software solutions at scale, it will take a community. This portal is meant to provide a platform with the necessary documentation, code, tools and resources needed to adequately bring personal healthcare exchanges to every individual in the country. The Amida Tech Developer Community will be the one-stop location for developers to find what they need to develop, deploy and manage Personal Health Information Exchanges (PHIX).</p>
