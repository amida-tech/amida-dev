<h3>Authentication</h3>

<p><img src="images/bw-identification.png" align="right" width="200" style="padding: 15px;" /></p>

<p>The authentication for PHIX is currently a cookie based authentication. All API access begins with the account /login API endpoint, which doesnâ€™t require authentication, but upon a valid request will return a cookie in the response named phix.sid.</p>

<p>This cookie will need to be returned as a header with all future API calls, otherwise you will receive a 401 response status code. You should be able to pass this phis.id as a header in any programming language.</p>

<p>This PHIX support site uses an additional layer of authentication by requiring an app key and secret, which allows the interactive documentation to securely interact with a proxy of a sandbox version of the PHIX platform. You will not need the second layer of security for your own PHIX installation, unless you so choose as part of your security strategy.</p>
