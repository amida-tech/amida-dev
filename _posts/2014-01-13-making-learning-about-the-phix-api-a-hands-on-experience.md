#Making Learning About The PHIX API A Hands On Experience

Learning about any API can be a time consuming process, and when APIs involve classic, static documentation, this process is anything but exciting. The quickest way to improve the user experience of learning about any API is making it a hands on experience.

We are making every PHIX API endpoint a live experience by designing and deploying a live JavaSCript documentation that using a proxy, authenticates with a sandbox version of PHIX, then allows any developers to to make live calls against the API, seeing live responses, while exploring the documentation.

When you can explore the PHIX API in this way, you can actually add accounts, update profiles, and understand the finer points of how the PHIX application worksâ€”which can go a long way to expedite the API education process.

To step up API education, we will also be seamlessly integrating the API documentation with a step by step walk through of the PHIX platform, providing multiple ways to learn about how to best integrate with PHIX.
