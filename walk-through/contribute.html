<p>PHIX is a community effort and we encourage your contribution. The Github issue manager is the doorway to contributing to the community, so if you have any code, resources, stories or anything youâ€™d like to contribute, please add a reference on the Github issue page.</p>

<p>PHX is looking to be a vast ecosystem of developers, technologists and healthcare practitioners with one mission: empower individuals to take control of their health care information. To make this work, the community needs you involved, so please contribute.</p>
