Personal Health Information eXchange or PHIX is looking to provide everyone with their own, private solution for securely storing their health information, providing them with a platform in which they can communicate and interact with their healthcare providers.

To be able to deliver on this vision, Amida needs a community of developers.  Amida needs you to learn about PHIX, deploy individual nodes that users can put to use, managing their healthcare information, and take control of their relationships with their healthcare providers.

It will be up to developers to seamlessly integrate PHIX deployments with existing healthcare provider systems. Amida won’t be able to support all healthcare providers, it is up to developers to deliver this last mile.

As the community of developers grow, the number of PHIX deployments increases, the valuable experience and feedback from the developer community will be incorporated into future iterations of PHIX—truly making PHIX a community healthcare solution.
