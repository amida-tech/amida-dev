      Amida strives to make health data accessible to modern developers by
      abstracting away the complex nuances of historical formats.
    </p>
    <p>
      The purpose of the Data Reconciliation Engine (DRE) is to take personal health data
      in a variety of formats (starting with BlueButton/CCDA) from multiple
      sources and parse/normalize/de-duplicate/merge it into a single Patient's
      Master Health Record (with patient assistance), although most of hard
      work will be done automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      DRE relies heavily on the blue-button family of libraries to parse health
      record data in variety of formats into unified data model (JSON based),
      so information can be readily utilized for any application.
    </p>
    <p>PHIX is an open source personal health information exchange that encourages developers and technology providers to download, install and get to work understanding and developing with PHIX.</p>
     <p>This site is designed to help you get going, no matter what your level of understanding of PHIX is. The left hand side of this getting started page is meant to take you to the place you need to get going.</p>
     <p>If you are just getting started, we recommend starting with the walk-through. It will take you step by step through all elements of PHIX, helping you get started with your understanding of the PHIX platform, API and how to deploy and integrate with other healthcare information systems.</p>
     <p>If you already have an understanding of PHIX, you should play with the interactive documentation which lets you explore the API interface and see how it all works in real-time.</p>
     <p>If you are ready, go ahead and download, install and get working with PHIX. Some developers learn better by actually playing with the code.</p>
     <p>Make sure and look at the other resources available that will help you, stay in tune with updates, and make sure and use the PHIX support when you need help, have comments or feeback.</p>
